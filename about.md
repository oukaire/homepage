### Early Life and Education
I was born in Abuja, Nigeria. I spent most of my childhood between Suleja and Abuja, Nigeria. I graduated from Federal Government Academy in 2012 and African Leadership Academy in 2014.

### Abridged Autobiography
Coming from a humble background, Ukay is thankful to have been exposed to a wealth of experiences that makes him demonstrate servant leadership. He acknowledges that despite his hard-work and pursuit, his personal journey would have not been possible without help from many teachers, tutors and friends. He brings energy to a team, as he is a fun conversationalist, facilitator and pace-setter. 

### Hobbies
I have a deep passion for sports.  I love playing football and table-tennis. I am also a dance enthusiast. I have a 30-minute daily routine of stepping out of his comfort zone to learn something new; that's how I feel in love with [Aeon](https://aeon.co). I love playing video games when I have free time. I do not often read literary books, but I enjoy reading technical journals and periodicals to remain current.

### Favorite Sport Teams
With gleeful gusto, I have been an FC Barcelona fan since 2005 with Ronaldinho as my secret hero.  Ditto for New England's patriots in American football and the Boston Celtics in NBA. I seldom follow tennis and golf : go Roger Federer, go Roy Mcllroy!
